# Understanding and Managing Destructive Behavior in Dogs

As a dog expert, I hear from many dog parents who are experiencing issues with their dogs becoming destructive. They chew up furniture, shoes, and other household items. They bark incessantly, run around wildly, and may even become aggressive towards people or other animals.

But the truth is that the problem is not with the dog. Rather, it is with the lack of structure and stimulation in their daily lives. Dogs are highly intelligent animals with a need for mental and physical stimulation. Without proper outlets for their energy, they can become bored, frustrated, and even anxious, leading to destructive behavior.

## Why Do Dogs Become Destructive?

To understand why dogs become destructive, we need to delve into the workings of their brains. Despite having a brain that is less than 0.5% of their body weight, 20% of the blood pumped by their heart goes directly to their brain. This means that their brains are highly active, and they require stimulation to keep them engaged and happy. Now, think about the daily routine of your dog. How much time do they spend behind four walls, with little to no interaction with the outside world? Many dog parents claim that they leave their dogs open to play, but without structure, running around in the same place can be just as boring as being locked up indoors.

## Adding Structure to Your Dog’s Daily Routine

To help your dog use their brain constructively, you need to add structure to their daily routine. This can involve taking them for walks, playing with them, teaching them new tricks, and providing them with toys and puzzles to keep them occupied.

### Walks

Walks are a crucial part of a dog’s daily routine. They allow them to explore the world, experience new smells, and get some exercise. Dogs who are left alone all day without walks can become bored, anxious, and destructive. Walking your dog twice a day can provide them with the necessary stimulation to keep them happy and healthy.

### Playtime

Playing with your dog is another excellent way to stimulate their brain. Dogs love to play fetch, tug-of-war, and hide-and-seek. Playing with your dog not only helps to tire them out physically, but it also helps to keep their minds sharp.

### Training

Teaching your dog new tricks is an excellent way to provide them with mental stimulation. Dogs are intelligent creatures and love to learn. Teaching them new tricks not only provides them with the stimulation they need, but it also strengthens the bond between you and your dog.

### Toys and Puzzles

In addition to walks, playtime, and training, providing your dog with toys and puzzles can also help to keep them mentally stimulated. Puzzle toys, such as treat-dispensing toys, can provide a fun and challenging activity for your dog to enjoy while you are away from home. Chew toys and puzzle feeders are also great options to keep your dog occupied and prevent destructive chewing.

## Understanding Your Dog’s Specific Needs

It’s important to note that some dogs may have specific needs that require extra attention. For example, some dogs may need more exercise or mental stimulation than others due to their breed, age, or health. It’s crucial to understand your dog’s individual needs and adjust their routine accordingly.

## When to Seek Professional Help

In some cases, destructive behavior in dogs may also be a sign of underlying health issues or anxiety. If you have tried to add structure to your dog’s daily routine and their behavior persists, it’s important to consult with your veterinarian or a OhMyDog Approved Professional dog behaviorists to identify any underlying issues and develop a plan to address them.

## Conclusion

Dogs become destructive when they don’t have enough stimulation and structure in their daily lives. As responsible dog parents, it’s our job to provide our dogs with the necessary mental and physical stimulation to keep them happy, healthy, and well-behaved. By adding structure to your dog’s daily routine, including regular walks, playtime, training, and toy puzzles, you can prevent destructive behavior and foster a strong bond with your beloved pet. Remember, a tired and stimulated dog is a happy dog!
