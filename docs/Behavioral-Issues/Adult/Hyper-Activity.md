# Managing Hyperactivity in Dogs

## Understanding Hyperactivity

How do you behave when your puppy comes running towards you and starts jumping on you?

Most humans get excited, they pick the puppy up, they give affection, they baby talk, they nurture the excitement in the puppy.

### Why This Happens

Because humans think that excitement and happiness both are the same emotions but in reality, these emotions are far from each other.

In the animal world, excitement is unstable energy. You will not see zebras in the wild jumping out of excitement because in the wild, excitement means deathâ€”they will be among the first to be hunted down.

### The Human Factor

But because of our lack of understanding, we treat excitement as happiness and keep on nurturing the excited state of mind from puppyhood until it becomes uncomfortable for us to manage once the puppy grows up into a big dog.

Unintentionally, we trained our puppy to meet with excitement all the time and one day we started to behave with frustration instead of affection, which sends the dog into a confused state that leads to hyperactivity and anxiety.

## Correcting the Behavior

### The Wrong Approach

Giving affection was wrong, and behaving with frustration is super duper wrong. It's you who trained your dog to be in a hyperexcited state; this is not his fault. Your frustration is just you not taking responsibility for your actions.

### The Right Approach

So, remember, whenever a dog receives affection, his or her state of mind gets nurtured. And excitement is not happiness.

To manage hyperactivity:
1. **Stay Calm:** Always approach your dog with a calm demeanor.
2. **Consistent Training:** Reinforce calm behavior with consistent training.
3. **Controlled Affection:** Give affection when your dog is in a calm state, not when they are excited.
4. **Exercise and Mental Stimulation:** Ensure your dog gets enough physical exercise and mental stimulation to help manage their energy levels.

By understanding and correctly managing your dog's excitement and hyperactivity, you can help them lead a more balanced and happy life.
