# Shy and Insecure Dog

Have you ever noticed some dogs that seem a bit more timid or unsure of themselves?

Just like people, dogs can also experience feelings of sensitivity and insecurity.

As a dog behaviorist, it’s my job to help these dogs feel more confident and happy in their lives.

## Understand Sensitivity

First things first, it’s important to understand what sensitivity means for our canine companions. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive to their surroundings, noises, and new experiences. They may become nervous or fearful in certain situations, which can impact their overall confidence. Remember, being sensitive doesn’t mean anything is wrong with your dog; it’s just part of who they are.

## Do Not Give Affection When Dog Is Nervous

When your dog is feeling nervous or insecure, it’s important to avoid giving them affection right away. This might sound counterintuitive, but showering them with hugs and kisses when they’re scared can reinforce their anxious behavior.

## Bring Structure into Your Dog’s Life

Dogs thrive on routine and structure. By establishing a consistent daily schedule, you can help your dog feel more secure and confident. Set regular times for feeding, walks, and playtime. Knowing what to expect each day can provide your dog with a sense of stability and predictability.

## Learn How to Give a Structured Walk

Taking your dog for a walk is not only a great way to exercise them physically but also an opportunity to boost their confidence. When walking your sensitive dog, try using a structured approach. This means maintaining a steady pace, using a short leash to keep them close, and giving clear commands to guide their behavior.

## Take Your Dog on Treks, Hikes, or Agility Programs

Engaging your dog in adventurous activities can be a fantastic confidence booster. Consider taking them on exciting treks or hikes where they can explore new sights, smells, and sounds. Agility programs can also be a great way to build their confidence through structured, fun exercises.

By understanding your dog’s sensitivity, providing a calm presence, establishing structure, offering structured walks, and engaging in exciting adventures, you’ll be well on your way to helping your sensitive and insecure dog become a more confident and happy companion.

So let’s get started on this journey of boosting our dogs’ confidence and watching them thrive in their own unique way!
