# Puppy Issues

Welcome to the Puppy Issues section of the OhMyDog Educational Portal. Here, we address common challenges faced by dog parents with puppies and provide practical solutions and advice.

## Common Puppy Issues

### 1. Destroying Objects

Puppies are naturally curious and may chew on furniture, shoes, and other household items.

#### Solutions:
- **Provide Chew Toys:** Give your puppy plenty of appropriate chew toys to satisfy their chewing instincts.
- **Puppy-Proof Your Home:** Keep valuable or dangerous items out of your puppy's reach.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Praise and reward your puppy when they chew on appropriate items.

### 2. Puppy Biting

Puppies explore the world with their mouths, which can lead to biting behavior.

#### Solutions:
- **Redirect:** If your puppy bites you, redirect them to a chew toy.
- **Socialization:** Expose your puppy to different people and dogs to teach bite inhibition.
- **Training:** Use consistent commands and rewards to discourage biting.

### 3. Pee/Poop Training

Housebreaking a puppy requires patience and consistency.

#### Solutions:
- **Regular Schedule:** Take your puppy outside at regular intervals, especially after eating, drinking, and waking up.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Praise and reward your puppy when they go potty outside.
- **Crate Training:** Use a crate to help your puppy learn bladder control.

### 4. Hyperactivity

Puppies have a lot of energy and may display hyperactive behavior.

#### Solutions:
- **Exercise:** Provide ample physical exercise through walks and playtime.
- **Mental Stimulation:** Use puzzle toys and training sessions to challenge your puppy's mind.
- **Consistent Routine:** Establish a daily routine to help manage your puppy's energy levels.
