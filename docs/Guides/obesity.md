### An Easy-to-Follow, Simplistic Guide to Prevent and Reverse Obesity in Dogs

### What This Guide Is About (and What It’s Not About)
Hello, my name is Sunny Luthra...

Before we get started, I want to introduce myself and let you know what this guide is about (and more importantly, what it’s not about).

This guide is NOT about what food is good or bad or how much a dog should eat — yet the “Easy to Follow Simplistic Guide to Prevent and Reverse Obesity in Dogs” I’m going to share with you will help you achieve exceptional results with your dog.

This guide is NOT about teaching you dog nutrition — yet this information will prove to be very beneficial in everyday life.

If you are a first-time dog parent or have raised many and want to keep your dog happy and healthy, then based on my experience, after working with hundreds of dogs and humans, I’ve found that it is best to focus on feeding frequency; it is the key to having a healthy and happy dog.

So, how often should you feed your dog and why?

THAT is what this guide is about.

### What Is the Meaning of Obesity?

It was the summer of 2016 when my neighbor got a dog, a female Pug named Rumy. At that time, I didn’t know much about dogs.

I witnessed how Rumy was pampered by her family and everyone in the building. There were over 200 flats in the society, and she received love from all the kids and adults.

Rumy’s immediate family was small, just a young boy and his mother. She was living a joyful life, or so it seemed.

The boy ate a lot of chocolates and started feeding them, along with biscuits, to Rumy. People often see this as cute, but chocolate and most human food are toxic for dogs. Such foods can send a dog’s blood sugar levels sky-high.

Soon, Rumy became obese, then developed cataracts, diabetes, and eventually lost both of her eyes. Tragically, she died within two years of being born. Her death was not due to genetic disease but the lifestyle imposed by her humans. Their negligence and lack of control over their emotions took Rumy’s life.

For a dog, the meaning of obesity is DEATH.

Diseases like osteoarthritis, diabetes, and thyroid disorders are rampant in dogs. In their natural habitat, you almost never find dogs with these diseases. (Side note: these are human-created diseases.)

There are many dogs like Rumy suffering due to our negligence and lack of control over our emotions. Through this guide, my goal is to make people aware that prioritizing the health of our dogs is essential for them to live a happy, disease-free life.

Before advising responsible dog parents on their dog's health issues, I was helping people transform their own health by educating them about “How the Body and Mind Work.”

I started researching how a dog’s body works and consulted with veterinary doctors. I realized that the physiology of humans and dogs is remarkably similar; the way organs function in our bodies mirrors their functioning in a dog’s body.

I have helped many humans lose weight and gain health through my easy-to-follow, simplistic methods. I believe health is simple, but we have made it complex. Isn’t that so?

Rumy’s death deeply impacted me. I could have helped her by firmly communicating with her parents. I got angry at them, but what was needed was compassion. I should have approached them with calmness, confidence, and compassion if I truly wanted to help Rumy.

With calmness, confidence, and compassion, I am presenting this easy-to-follow simplistic guide to prevent and reverse obesity in dogs.

Happy Reading, My Dear Responsible Dog Parents.

### How to Recognize Obesity

This is a question many people ask. It is crucial to know the answer if we want to prevent obesity in our dogs. I believe prevention is easier than reversing obesity.

I also believe obesity can be easily recognized if we remain honest with ourselves. But how do we recognize it in the early stages when the dog is not evidently obese?

Here are simple steps to determine your dog’s health from a weight perspective:

1. Check from the top view: If your dog’s shape is oval, then they are obese or moving towards obesity.
2. Check if you can easily feel their last two ribs. If not, they are obese or moving towards obesity. (This is an excellent indicator.)

You should be able to feel the last two ribs easily. If you can’t, then adjustments to their diet are necessary.

### Which Dogs Are Most at Risk for Becoming Obese?

People generally believe certain breeds are more prone to obesity, but in reality, any food-motivated dog who can make puppy eyes and whose humans easily give in to their demands is at risk for becoming obese.

Any dog can become obese if they are food-motivated.

### How Do Dogs Reach This State?

In their natural habitat, you will rarely see overweight dogs. Humans are living very sedentary lifestyles and consuming more food than needed, and we are doing the same with our dogs.

This is due to our negligence and lack of knowledge about how devastating obesity or being overweight is for a dog.

Dogs are getting obese or overweight because we are feeding them 3-4 times a day, including main meals, small meals, and treats. Their bodies are not built to consume so much food so frequently.

We need to control our emotions, which make us feel like our dog is constantly hungry and needs more food.

Is that love, or is it our incapability of handling our emotions?

“I don’t feed my dogs frequently, but my family does, so it’s hard to control them.”

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

The life and death of your dog are at stake. Take a stand and be firm. The entire family should be on the same page regarding the dog’s health. It is our responsibility to provide them with a healthy, happy life.

### Prevention & Reversal Measures

A dog should never reach the state of being overweight or obese. You can’t imagine the stress they feel when they become overweight.

Dogs love to play, but as they become overweight, they start losing their play drive because it’s too much for their joints to handle.

Some people think exercise alone can help their dog lose weight. NO! Exercise puts pressure on already deteriorating joints.

The main focus must be on the food you are feeding your dog.

The following is an easy-to-follow, simplistic approach to help your dog lose weight and gain health within three weeks:

#### STEP #1: Where Are We Now?
Note how many times you feed your dog. This is not about how much, but how frequently. Record every instance: main meals, treats, small meals, anything your dog eats, and at what time.
(Example: main meal, treats, small meals, from your plate, from other family members, biscuit, roti, etc.)

#### STEP #2: Where Do We Want to Be?
Your dog should be strictly on two meals a day, with no daily treats (if overweight, then no treats at all until reaching optimal weight). The window between the two meals should be under six hours. (Example: if the dog gets the first meal at 1:00 pm, the next meal should be given before or at 6:00 pm. This process will trigger autophagy, meaning the dog’s body will start recycling dead cells, microbes, fungi, and viruses into raw material for new cells, facilitating weight loss.)

#### STEP #3: How to Achieve This?
We aim for two meals a day, but currently, we might be feeding them 4-5 times daily. Here’s how to bring them to two meals a day:

1. Have a meeting with all family members and explain your plan. Everyone should be on the same page. (If they don’t understand, please let me know, and we can team up and schedule a Zoom call with them.)
2. Stop giving treats until your dog reaches the appropriate weight.
3. Stop all meals except the main meals; no in-between meals.
4. If you give more than two main meals, delay them by 15 minutes each day until you reach the point where you can combine the first and second meals.
5. If you already give only two main meals, shorten the window between meals to six hours or less by delaying the first meal by 15 minutes and advancing the second meal by 15 minutes daily.
6. Establish a fixed feeding schedule.
7. Always pick up the bowl within five minutes if the dog is not interested in eating. Don’t worry, and provide the meal at the next scheduled time.

Take some time to plan this, so that your dog can live a happy, healthy life.

### Conclusion

Obesity in dogs is not just a minor health issue; it is a life-threatening condition that greatly diminishes their quality of life. As responsible dog parents, it is our duty to ensure that our beloved companions lead healthy, happy lives. Throughout this guide, we've discussed the significance of recognizing obesity early, understanding the risks associated with it, and implementing a straightforward, effective plan to prevent and reverse this condition.

By focusing on feeding frequency, adhering strictly to a two-meal-a-day schedule, and eliminating unnecessary treats, we can help our dogs maintain optimal health. This guide provides practical steps that are easy to follow, ensuring that your efforts to combat obesity in your dog do not become overwhelming.

Remember, consistency and commitment are key. The well-being of your dog hinges on your ability to manage their diet and exercise routine properly. By implementing the measures outlined in this guide, you will not only extend your dog’s lifespan but also enhance their overall quality of life. 

Let’s take a firm stand together and make a conscious effort to prioritize the health of our dogs. With calmness, confidence, and compassion, we can prevent and reverse obesity, allowing our furry friends to enjoy the happy, active lives they deserve.

Thank you for choosing to be a responsible and caring dog parent. On this journey towards health, both you and your dog will reap the benefits of a happier, more vibrant life. Happy reading, and even happier dog parenting!
