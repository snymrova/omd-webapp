![OhMyDog Cover Banner](../../static/img/structured-walk-guide-cover.webp)

### 1. **Begin a Structured Walk Routine**
   - **Frequency:** Take your dog on a structured walk **twice a day**.
   - **Duration:** Each walk should last between **30 to 45 minutes**.

### 2. **Set a Fixed Walk Schedule**
   - **Consistency:** Walk your dog at the **same time every day**. This helps create a routine that your dog can anticipate and rely on.

### 3. **Walk at a Brisk Pace**
   - **Speed:** Aim to walk at a pace that is **1.5 to 1.7 times** your normal walking speed. This helps burn off your dog's energy more effectively.

### 4. **Follow a Structured Walk Pattern**
   - **Breaks:** Walk for **15 minutes**, then allow your dog a **2-5 minute break**. Repeat this cycle **2-3 times** during each walk. This structure helps in teaching your dog discipline while keeping the walk engaging.

### 5. **End the Walk with Calm Behavior**
   - **At Home:** Conclude the walk by having your dog **sit outside the gate of your house** while on a leash.
   - **Calmness:** Wait for your dog to become calm before bringing them inside. This reinforces calm behavior as the walk concludes.

### 6. **Create a Resting Place at Home**
   - **Designated Area:** Set up a **secluded spot** in your home where your dog can relax. This should be in a quiet corner and may be partially covered to create a sense of security.
  
### 7. **End the Walk with a Relaxing Activity**
   - **Leash at Resting Spot:** Once home, lead your dog to their designated resting spot and keep them leashed there.
   - **Chew Time:** Give your dog a **natural bone** to chew on for **10-15 minutes**. This serves as a reward and helps them unwind after the walk.
   - **Unleash:** After the chew time, you can unleash your dog to relax fully.

### 8. **Maintain Consistency**
   - **21-Day Rule:** Be consistent with this routine for **21 days**. Consistency is key to seeing significant improvements in your dog's behavior.

## Why This Routine Works

Structured walks are more than just exercise—they are an essential part of your dog’s mental and physical well-being. Here’s why this routine is effective:

1. **Burns Excess Energy:**
   - By increasing the pace and structuring the walk with intervals, your dog expends more energy, reducing the likelihood of hyperactivity or destructive behavior at home.

2. **Promotes Mental Stimulation:**
   - A fixed schedule and structured walk pattern provide mental challenges that keep your dog engaged. Dogs thrive on routine, and this predictability helps them feel secure and calm.

3. **Reinforces Discipline and Obedience:**
   - The structured approach teaches your dog to follow your lead, wait patiently during breaks, and remain calm before re-entering the house. These small but consistent practices contribute to overall better behavior.

4. **Supports Rest and Recovery:**
   - Ending the walk with a period of calmness and a relaxing activity like chewing on a natural bone allows your dog to transition smoothly from physical exertion to rest. This not only helps in calming them down but also encourages a healthy routine of activity followed by relaxation.

## Tips for Success

- **Stay Calm and Consistent:** Your dog takes cues from your behavior. If you remain calm and assertive during the walks, your dog is more likely to mirror that behavior.
- **Be Patient:** It might take a few days for your dog to adjust to this new routine. Consistency is
